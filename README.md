# webcrawlerhttp
Project for the Learn HTTP Course

I did this project following a boot.dev tutorial, after completing an introductory JS class. 
This project was finished before starting my coding bootcamp.

Here are some of the valuable skills I was able to exercise while following this tutorial:
1. Downloading and using Jest
2. Running tests on .test.js docs
3. Debugging code to ensure it runs as expected
4. Following detailed and complex instructions to complete a project
5. Using JS to build a working program
