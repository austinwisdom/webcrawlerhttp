Project for the Learn HTTP Course

I did this project following a boot.dev tutorial, after completing an introductory JS class. 
This project was finished before starting my coding bootcamp.

Although I followed the tutorial, I learned and was able to practice some valuable skills:
1. Downloading and using Jest
2. Running tests on a .test.js doc
3. Debugging code to ensure it runs as expected
4. Following detailed and complex instructions to complete a project
